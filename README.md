Diabetes Prediction Using Supervised Models
Business Understanding
Stark Health Clinic is a leading healthcare provider that leverages technology and predictive modeling to enhance its operations. By integrating machine learning into its systems, the clinic identifies diseases early, improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.

Problem Definition
Stark Health Clinic faces a significant challenge in accurately identifying patients at risk of developing diabetes. This challenge results in suboptimal early detection and prevention strategies, which can have serious consequences for patient health and well-being.

Rationale of the project
The current approach to identifying at-risk patients lacks precision, leading to missed opportunities for timely interventions. This can result in compromised patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. The clinic's inability to accurately identify high-risk patients hinders its ability to provide proactive care and effective disease management.

Objective
By harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop a robust predictive model that accurately identifies high-risk patients. This model will enable proactive healthcare interventions, improving patient outcomes and reducing the economic burden of diabetes. Additionally, the project will enhance the clinic's reputation for innovative, data-driven care, positioning it as a leader in the healthcare industry.

Data Colletion
The dataset used for this project is "Diabetics Prediction Dataset" made available by 10Alytics

Project Workflow
A. Business and Data Understanding

B. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis in Python:

1) Visualize relationships between the target and some key features

2) Explore correlations

3) Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis as much as is feasible

C. Perform Feature Engineering:

1) Encoding categorical variables

2) Create new features from existing features where necessary, depending on insights from your EDA

D. Model Selection, Training and Validation:

1) Train and test at least 3 supervised learning models

E. Model Evaluation:

1) Analyze the results of your trained models

2a) Identify the most important evalution metrics for this work.

2b) Investigate the effect of false negatives or true positives on delivering better result for a business
